by Xiaoren Yang

open 'project2.html' with chrome.
click 'choose file' button, select input files to test.
click 'draw'. The picture will show up.

'lsysOwnStochastic1.txt', 'lsysOwnStochastic2.txt' are two input file I write

Explanation about the model:

'model.js' contains all the class I define. I use ECMAScript 6 to define the class. So only chrome will work.  
The way I model is a little bit different from the instruction on the web page.
Class 'LSystem' contains all the information about the input file. When the LSystem object is constructed, it will rewrite itself. 
Class 'Grammar' contains a list of Rules. Routine 'getRhs' return the rhs base on the input lhs. It handles the case of multiple rhs. 
Class 'Rule' contains lhs and rhs, if the this rule has multiple rhs, those rhs will store in a list. 

'polyCylinder.js' contains the routine to generate sphere, cylinder and terrian. 

'project2.js' is the main script. The radius, theta and phi of camera placed at the top of the file. 
'inputFile' routine deals with the input file. Click 'choose file' button at the top. Choose one file at a time. 
'parseFile' help function parse the file. called in 'inputFile'. 
'vertexGenerate' working on the vertex points and colors array. First generate the terrian, then multiple trees.

'render' render the terrian and multiple trees. 'renderLSystem' is the help function to render the tree. 

'sample.jpg' is the sample result of all 7 lsys files.
